```

## Configuration

### Site

In your `config.[toml|json|yaml]`:

```toml

[author]
# Full name of your site's author.
name = "Danny Sausages"

[author.twitter]
# Twitter account of your site's author. Optional.
creator = "@CariadEccleston"

# Twitter account of your site's brand.
# Optional and defaults to the creator above.
site = "@PrinterOnFire"

[params]
  # Fathom Analytics (referral link: https://usefathom.com/ref/TVWIFS) site ID.
  # Optional and defaults to no Fathom integration.
  fathom = "MACARONI"

  # Emoji to use as the site's favicon.
  # Optional and defaults to ðŸ”¥.
  favicon = "ðŸ”¥"

  # Greeting to show in the sidebar and home page.
  greeting = "Hello! I'm Danny Sausages and I'm your personal chef."

  # Path to your image page bundle.
  # Optional and defaults to "/images".
  images = "/images"

[params.opengraph]
# Accessible text for your OpenGraph image.
# Optional and defaults to your site's name if an image is specified.
alt = "Danny Sausages"

# Path to your OpenGraph image. Do not prefix with a slash if your "baseURL"
# ends with one. Optional and defaults to no OpenGraph image.
image = "opengraph.png"

[params.sideNav]
  # Title of the page list in the sidebar.
  # Optional and defaults to "Pages".
  title = "Pages"

[params.sideNav.home]
  # Whether or not to include a home link in the sidebar page list.
  # Optional and defaults to true.
  include = true

  # Title of the home link in the sidebar page list.
  # Optional and defaults to "Home".
  title = "Home"

  # URI of the home link in the sidebar page list.
  # Optional and defaults to "/".
  uri = "/"
```

### Sections

To include a section on the home page, create an `_index.md` file in the section's directory with the following front matter:

```yaml
---
# Label for links to more of the section's pages.
# Optional and defaults to "More".
more_text: More posts

# Puts the section on the home page.
# Required.
on_home: true

# Section title.
# Required.
title: Blog posts

# Prescribes the (ascending) order of sections.
# Optional and defaults to whatever Hugo believes is best.
# Must be >0 if specified.
weight: 1
---
```

### Pages

To include a page in the sidebar, add the following front matter:

```yaml
---
# Puts the page in the side bar.
# Required.
on_side: true

# Page title.
# Required.
title: Blog posts

# Prescribes the (ascending) order of pages.
# Optional and defaults to whatever Hugo believes is best.
# Must be >0 if specified.
weight: 1
---
```

To hide your site's greeting from a page (for example, if the greeting repeats information on the page) then set `include_greeting: false`

## Images

To embed images, they must be stored in a [page bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/).

Your bundle's `index.md` should contain data like this:

```yaml
---
headless: true
resources:
  - name: parade
    params:
      alt: An ice cream parade on Pluto.
    src:  spine.jpg
    title: Ice Cream Parade
---
```

`params.alt` prescribes the image's accessible text and `name` is the identifier to use when embedding images via the `image` shortcode.

```markdown
Do you remember last year's ice cream parade?

{{< image parade >}}

It was so good!
```
